            <p class="lead">An online voting system allows voters to cast their votes for candidates electronically. It
                is developed using HTML, CSS
                for the interface, JavaScript for dynamic interaction, PHP for server-side functionality, and MySQLi for
                managing and
                storing voter and candidate data. The system ensures that each voter can vote securely and efficiently,
                with real-time
                updates on voting status.</p>

            <h3 class="heading text-white">Project Overview</h2><br>
            <p>The Online Voting System is a web application designed to facilitate the electoral process by enabling
                voters to cast
                their votes for candidates conveniently and securely over the internet. The primary purpose of this
                project is to
                simplify the voting process, increase voter participation, and ensure the integrity of the election
                results.<br><br>

                <h3 class="heading text-white">Purpose:<br></h3>
                In traditional voting systems, long queues, logistical challenges, and limited accessibility can
                discourage voter
                participation. This online voting system addresses these issues by providing a user-friendly platform
                where voters can
                register, log in, view candidate profiles, and cast their votes from the comfort of their homes or any
                location with
                internet access. The system aims to enhance the transparency of the voting process and make it more
                accessible to a
                broader audience.<br><br>

                <h3 class="heading text-white">Technologies Used:<br></h3>
                <b class="heading text-white">HTML:</b> Utilized for creating the structure and layout of the web pages.<br><br>
                <b class="heading text-white">CSS:</b> Employed for styling the application, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design
                that enhances user
                experience.<br><br>
                <b class="heading text-white">JavaScript:</b> Implemented for client-side scripting to enhance interactivity, including form
                validation and dynamic
                updates without refreshing the page.<br><br>
                <b class="heading text-white">PHP:</b> Used for server-side scripting to handle user requests, manage sessions, and process votes
                securely.<br><br>
                <b class="heading text-white">MySQLi:</b> A MySQL extension that enables the application to interact with the database, storing
                voter information,
                candidate details, and vote records safely and efficiently.<br>
                This project demonstrates a robust application of web development technologies to solve real-world
                problems, promoting
                democratic participation and transparency in the electoral process. The system is built with a focus on
                security and
                user experience, ensuring that votes are cast confidentially and that the integrity of the election
                results is
                maintained.<br>
