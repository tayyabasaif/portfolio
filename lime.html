            <p class="lead">A Limelight clone is an online shopping store developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It
            features product listings, user authentication, shopping cart functionality, and a seamless checkout process. The store
            allows users to browse, search for products, add items to their cart, and make purchases, with all data stored securely
            in MongoDB. React handles the user interface, ensuring a dynamic and responsive shopping experience.</p>

            <h3 class="heading text-white">Project Overview</h2><br>
            <p>The Limelight Clone is an online shopping store built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). It
            replicates the functionality of the popular Limelight clothing store, allowing users to browse products, add them to a
            shopping cart, and complete purchases online. The system is designed to provide a seamless and intuitive shopping
            experience with a modern, responsive user interface.</p><br>

            <h3 class="heading text-white">Purpose:<br></h3>
            <p>The purpose of this project is to create a fully functional e-commerce platform where users can explore a range of
            products, manage their shopping cart, and securely place orders. The goal is to deliver a smooth and engaging user
            experience, similar to real-world online shopping platforms. The project focuses on providing features such as product
            browsing, user authentication, shopping cart management, and order processing. Additionally, the system offers a secure
            backend for managing products, users, and orders.</p>
            
            <p> Limelight clone is ideal for demonstrating e-commerce functionalities and learning how to integrate different
            components of the MERN stack to build dynamic and responsive web applications.</p><br>

                <h3 class="heading text-white">Technologies Used:<br></h3>
                <b class="heading text-white">MongoDB (Database):</b> MongoDB is used to store all data related to products, users, orders, and categories. As a NoSQL database, it allows for
                flexible storage of large datasets and scalable data management.<br><br>
                <b class="heading text-white">Express.js (Backend Framework):</b> Express is the backend framework used to handle server-side logic, manage API routes, and connect with the MongoDB
                database. It powers the core functionalities such as user authentication, product data retrieval, and order processing.<br><br>
            
                <b class="heading text-white">React.js (Frontend Framework):</b> React is used to build a dynamic and responsive user interface. It enables users to interact with the website in
                real-time, providing features like product browsing, shopping cart management, and order placement without needing to
                reload the page.
                React’s component-based architecture ensures that the code is modular, maintainable, and scalable.<br><br>
                <b class="heading text-white">Node.js (Runtime Environment):</b> React is used to build a dynamic and responsive user interface. It enables users to interact with the website in

                reload the page.
