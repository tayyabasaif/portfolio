            <p class="lead">The McDonald's Clone is an online shopping platform developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and
            Node.js). It simulates McDonald's online ordering system, allowing users to browse the menu, customize their meals, add
            items to their cart, and place orders in a smooth and intuitive manner. The platform focuses on providing a fast,
            interactive, and user-friendly experience similar to McDonald’s official online service.</p>

            <h2 class="heading text-white">Project Overview</h2><br>
            <p>The main objective of this project is to replicate the digital ordering experience of McDonald's, giving users the
            ability to order their favorite meals online. It simplifies the process of selecting menu items, customizing meals, and
            securely checking out. The clone aims to offer a streamlined user experience, reducing the time and effort required to
            place an order while also demonstrating the capabilities of the MERN stack in building a responsive and dynamic
            e-commerce system.<br />
            
            This project showcases how web technologies can be used to enhance customer convenience in the fast food industry by
            providing an easy-to-navigate platform for online ordering.<br><br>

                <h3 class="heading text-white">Purpose:<br></h3>
                In traditional voting systems, long queues, logistical challenges, and limited accessibility can
                discourage voter
                participation. This online voting system addresses these issues by providing a user-friendly platform
                where voters can
                register, log in, view candidate profiles, and cast their votes from the comfort of their homes or any
                location with
                internet access. The system aims to enhance the transparency of the voting process and make it more
                accessible to a
                broader audience.<br><br>

            <h3 class="heading text-white">Technologies Used:<br></h3>
            <b class="heading text-white">MongoDB (Database):</b> MongoDB stores all the data related to users, menu items, orders, and customization options. As a NoSQL database, it
            provides the flexibility and scalability required for managing dynamic menu data and customer orders.<br><br>
            <b class="heading text-white">Express.js (Backend Framework):</b> Express handles all the backend logic, including API endpoints for user authentication, order processing, and menu
            management. It connects the frontend to the database and manages server-side operations such as processing meal orders.<br><br>
            
            <b class="heading text-white">React.js (Frontend Framework):</b>React is responsible for building the interactive and responsive user interface. It enables users to browse the menu,
            customize items, add meals to the cart, and interact with the system in real-time without reloading the page.
            React’s state management handles the dynamic updates for cart contents and menu selections.<br><br>
            <b class="heading text-white">Node.js (Runtime Environment):</b> Node.js runs the server-side logic and provides an environment for executing JavaScript code on the backend. It
            facilitates real-time communication between the client and server for order processing and dynamic updates.
